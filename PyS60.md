Python for S60 is Nokia's port of the Python language to the S60 smartphone platform. In addition to the standard features of the Python language, PyS60 provides access to many of the phone's uniquely smartphone-y functions, such as camera, contacts, calendar, audio recording and playing, TCP/IP and Bluetooth communications and simple telephony.

It's open source, under Apache 2 and Python licenses. You can download the source for the latest release from garage.maemo.org or use community managed Python for Series 60 community edition which comes with some extra goodies for low level hackers.

...and what it is really about is making it not only possible but also easy and fun to hack these wonderful gadgets.
