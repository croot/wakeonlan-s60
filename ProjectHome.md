This simple application allows you to power on your computer wirelessly using your Symbian phone.
It works by sending the famous magic packet over WIFI to a computer connected to an ethernet wired network.
The main feature of this application is the **single click** wake on lan : once the application is configured, every time you click on the icon, your computer is powered on and the application automatically exit after a few seconds.

Limitations :
  * only one computer is supported in this version
  * it only works on local network


Requirements :
  * a Symbian phone (it has been tested on my Nokia E60 which is a S60 3rd edition Symbian)
  * a computer with an ethernet card where the Wake On Lan option has been enabled


Installation :
  * just download and execute the .sis file on your phone


Configuration :
  * MAC address of your computer
  * broadcast IP address of the network


This project has been developed really quickly thanks to the PyS60 platform that allow to code in python on Symbian S60 OS.
